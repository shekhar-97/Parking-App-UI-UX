# Parking-App-UI-UX
This contains wire-frames for an android app used to find parking spots in our university.
I used the Balsamiq software for designing the wireframes.
All the wireframes are in .png format.
This also contains a video to show how all the wireframes are connected to each other to make one smooth user experience.
Now i will name all the wireframes in the order they appear to the user and try to explain the functionalities of each one.
