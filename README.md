# Parking-App-UI-UX
This contains wire-frames for an android app used to find parking spots in our university.
I used the Balsamiq software for designing the wireframes.
All the wireframes are in .png format.
This also contains a video to show how all the wireframes are connected to each other to make one smooth user experience.
Video is compressed into "ParkOne-Designs.rar".
Now i will name all the wireframes in the order they appear to the user and try to explain the functionalities of each one.

1. Home tab : This is the first tab user see after opening the application. It gives the user to choose from two option buttons
              named "2 wheeler" or "4 wheeler" depending on what the user is looking for. The home tab also offers existing users
              the link to login and new users a link to sign up tab of the application.
2. Nav Bar  : This is the navigation bar which helps user to move through the application from the home tab itself. The navigation
              bar contains links to the bookinng tab, login/sign up, 2 wheelers tab, 4 wheelers tab, Location and help.
3. Login tab : This gives user different options to create an account or log in itno an existing one. This tab contains options 
               for users to directly link their facebook account or google account or create an account using email address or phone
               number.
4. 2 wheeler tab : This is the tab which will user go to when they click the "2 wheeler" button on the home tab. This tab contains
                   a dashboard which contains 4 tab buttons named "available" "booked" "handicap" "faculty". There's a search bar on
                   the top which can be used by user to search for specific locations around the university campus. 
                   This tab also contains a google maps API integrated which shows the exact points of parking spots on the map in the
                   form of small markings. so for example a student wants to find parking spot near Gate numer 3, So the student will
                   search Gate no. 3 in the search bar, and all the parking spots around gate number 3 will be shown on the map.
                   If a student clicks on a marking on the map that marking will take user to another tab named "spot details", which 
                   will let the student know about all the details related to that specific parking spot which that marking on the map
                   represents.
